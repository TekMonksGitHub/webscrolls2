  <p>In this post, I’ll introduce a reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm based
  on an “alternative” paradigm: divide and conquer. Unlike traditional methods,
  this algorithm is not based on temporal difference (TD) learning (which has
  scalability challenges), and scales well to long-horizon tasks. We can do
  Reinforcement Learning (RL) based on divide and conquer, instead of temporal
  difference (TD) learning.

  <h2>What exactly does word2vec learn?</h2>

  <p>

  What exactly does word2vec learn, and how? Answering this question amounts to
  understanding representation learning in a minimal yet interesting language
  modeling task. Despite the fact that word2vec is a well-known precursor to
  modern language models, for many years, researchers lacked a quantitative and
  predictive theory describing its learning process. In our new paper, we
  finally provide such a theory. We prove that there are realistic, practical
  regimes in which the learning problem reduces to unweighted least-squares
  matrix factorization. We solve the gradient flow dynamics in closed form; the
  final learned representations are simply given by PCA. Learning dynamics of
  word2vec. When trained from small initialization, word2vec learns in discrete,
  sequential steps. Left: rank-incrementing learning steps in the weight matrix,
  each decreasing the loss. Right: three time slices of the latent embedding
  space showing how embedding vectors expand into subspaces of increasing
  dimension at each learning step, continuing until model capacity is saturated.
